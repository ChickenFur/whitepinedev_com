      |I am the founder of WhitePineDev.  I was born in California raised all over the western United States. I love the outdoors and getting into the experience of "flow" 
      | while cycling, rockclimbing, programming and creating.  I have spent the last 10 years in the computer industry working in software and IT.
      | I have experience in python, cloud architecture in AWS, server admin for windows and linux as well as some C# and lots of experience just making things work.
